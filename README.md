# Deepfake-Detection-System-Python
This project implements a real-time deepfake detection system using Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-18 model for binary classification (Real vs. Fake) and Haar Cascades for face detection in video frames. The system can process video input from a webcam or a video file and display results in real time.
**Features**
Real-time face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascade.
Deepfake classification using a ResNet-18 model.
Support for webcam or video file input.
Displays bounding boxes and predictions ("Real" or "Fake") on detected faces.
**Requirements**
To run this project, make sure the following libraries are installed:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyTorch
torchvision
